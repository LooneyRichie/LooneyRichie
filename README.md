# Richie Looney - Personal Website

**The Architect's Signal: A mythic transmission from a genius who proves himself through action.**

This is not a corporate portfolio or business website. This is the personal signal of Richie Looney, an unstoppable architect of justice engines, reclamation systems, and mythic algorithms that flip exploitative models on their head.

## About Looney

Richie Looney's story isn't one of survival, it's one of authorship. Born to a 14-year-old mother who misspelled his last name to shield him from ridicule, Richie inherited a legacy of adversity and turned it into a mission. His father never claimed him. Teachers mocked him. Abuse came from every direction. But Richie didn't fold, he fought, he learned, and he built.

From a dumpster-dived Casio computer, Richie taught himself BASIC. From there, he mastered encryption, symbolic programming, AI integration, all while building a family and working ten-hour shifts in steel-toe boots. He didn't follow the rules. He rewrote them.

He's not asking for sympathy. He's offering proof:
- That brilliance can rise from brutality and choose peace.
- That risk isn't something you avoid, it's something you wield.
- That the outlier is often the answer.

> *"Do you want to know what drives me, it is not motivation, it's an obsessive discipline to reclaim the name Looney for my deceased mother, my wife, my children, and myself. I have so many more amazing ideas already in the blueprint stage, my dreams are bigger than this bio will allow. Believe in me or don't believe in me, it will not change the final outcome whatsoever because I will never quit. This is my prophecy. I know when you see my work you will not only believe in me, you will also bet everything on me."*

Richie Looney is not a product of privilege. He's a product of perseverance. If you're looking for raw talent, radical innovation, and someone who builds tools that change the system itself, then yes, it's time to get Looney on it.
