                        <p>I believe genius comes from everywhere, not just classrooms or boardrooms. I learned to code on a dumpster-dived computer because I had to build what I never had growing up. When life gave me nothing, I chose to create everything.</p>
                        
                        <p>After my mother passed, I did deep soul searching and discovered my true purpose: making the name <span class="looney-signature">Looney</span> synonymous with compassion through technology. Not madness, but meaningful systems that help people.</p>
                        
                        <p>As an INTJ humanitarian, I don't just build software.. I architect solutions that put people first. Every system I create is designed to support those who need it most.</p>
                        
                        <p>Every single day, I'm here building something better. Not for ego, but because someone else out there is going through what I went through. And maybe what I build today can help them tomorrow.</p>

                <div class="future-prophecy">
                    <p>One day it will be known that there is metal in every aluminum can, plastic in every plastic bottle, even glass in every glass bottle we drink from. Maybe the ancients had the right idea with clay instead of colored glass and metal and plastic and rubber because at least clay is more natural for ingestion.</p>
                    <p>One day it will be proven that everytime I swipe a surface gently I am in fact scraping an entire invisible layer of that surface off but if I did it 10 billion times it would be very noticeable, the same way water erodes gently over time.</p>
                    <p>One day in the future it will be known that there are beyond microscopic pieces of plastic, rubber, metal and all other known forms of matter floating right in the air in front of us.</p>
                    <p>One day it will be scientifically proven that there is no such thing as truly equal, only equal enough because true equality is an impossibility.</p>
                    <p>One day it will be proven that there is no such thing as flat either, even the most perfect line has curves undetectable to observation.</p>
                    <p>One day science will confirm that every single atom and molecule in existence in the entire universe is a unique incident.</p>
                    <p>One day the mystery of death will be solved: energy cannot disappear, it can only change form. Just because the energy is not physically visible does not make it any less real.</p>
                    <p>One day science will prove there is DNA shared between all living beings in existence.</p>
                    <p>One day it will be known that if there are alien beings and alien life forms of any kind, we share DNA with them as well.</p>
                    <p>One day we will realize we have no idea of what goes on in the magnitude of beyond microscopic vision.</p>
                    <p>This is only scratching the surface. I will continue to add and explore these truths until they are universally acknowledged.</p>
